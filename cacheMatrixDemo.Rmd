This file displays the output of a test function I wrote (cacheSolveTest) showing the correct behavior for the assignment functions:  makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve.

Note that not all matrices can be solved.  I used a matrix from an example I found at [http://www.endmemo.com/program/R/solve.php](as shown in the solve example at http://www.endmemo.com/program/R/solve.php).  Only 
the initial matrix values are from that site, the rest is my work.

```{r}
source('./cachematrix.R')
cacheSolveTest()
```
